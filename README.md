## By **Chris Sanchez**

**[Tilted Elephant Taproom](https://modest-ramanujan-ef0efe.netlify.com/#/)** is a website built for employees to manage keg inventory. Users can access the website regularly, with views of tap/keg lists, but no ability to perform authorized CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions. The front-end was built was React, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3/SASS/SCSS. The website features Routing performed through the `react-router-dom` package. The site features dynamic CSS classes depending on price per pint and number of beers left in each keg.

*State is a work in progress feature, the site is mostly static.*
